Ecosystem restoration (ER), a critical element of nature-based solutions, aims to return a degraded ecosystem to a stable state or reference condition. ER is important to reverse biodiversity loss, enhancing resilience to further disturbances. The need for ER on a large scale has been recognized by the United Nations sustainable development agenda and as part of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration (2021-2030).</p> <p>ER success is measured by ecosystem recovery, usually determined by three categories of ecosystem characteristics: vegetation structure, biodiversity, and ecological functioning (Ruiz-Jaen and Mitchell Aide 2005). Monitoring recovery is a challenge, as field-based measurements are impractical due to large spatial extents and a lack of resources and time. Field monitoring typically only occurs for short durations (&lt;5 years), but studies have found resilience and recovery to occur on longer time scales (&gt;10 years) (Pickell et al. 2016; Atkinson et al. 2022).</p> <p>Remote sensing of ER offers a solution in continuous monitoring of large spatial and temporal extents. Free and open satellite observation programs such as Landsat and Sentinel-2 have increased ER monitoring potential (Wulder et al. 2012), with further development of spectral vegetation indices (VIs) and remotely sensed essential biodiversity variables (RS-EBVs). VIs and RS-EBVs enable the extraction of vegetation health and recovery metrics (Skidmore et al. 2021), subsequently allowing estimation of ecosystem vegetation structure, diversity, and functioning (Cabello et al. 2012; Cordell et al. 2017).</p> <p>Trajectory-based time series analysis exploits temporal patterns in spectral values, proving to be effective for detecting and monitoring abrupt and gradual changes in ecosystem conditions (Banskota et al. 2014). However, previous analyses tend to explore only one spectral value or index, limiting the understanding of recovery dynamics, while change detection algorithms can be complex, unapproachable, and set with context-specific parameters, limiting more widespread applications (Cohen et al. 2018). This presents a barrier for effective use and interpretation of remotely sensed data for ER monitoring.</p>"},{"location":"#objective","title":"Objective:","text":"<p>The objective of the PEOPLE-ER Spectral Recovery tool is to provide an open source and multi-platform time series data analytics solution for both remote sensing research and ER monitoring purposes, which operates with freely available satellite imagery. It provides flexible methods for spectral recovery analysis, by providing users with the ability to select from a variety of spectral indices and recovery metrics as well as define reference or baseline conditions. The aim is to provide custom analyses ideal for widespread applications beyond site-specific contexts, with flexible reference conditions enabling direct integration with current ER initiatives and guidelines. The ability to calculate multiple per-pixel indices also provides remote sensing experts or researchers with the ability to easily produce spectrally derived products useful for further analysis.</p> <p>PEOPLE-ER aims to provide the tool such that monitoring of ER is more accessible to a variety of users, enabling computation of indices and metrics by users that do not necessarily have a background in remote sensing or computer science. In providing a singular solution, spectral time series analysis becomes more approachable, increasing the opportunity to apply remote sensing techniques to ER monitoring.</p>"},{"location":"#acknowledgements","title":"Acknowledgements","text":"<p>This tool was developed within the Pioneer Earth Observation apPlications for the Environment Ecosystem Restoration (PEOPLE-ER) project financed by the European Space Agency (ESA).

If no reference sites are provided, the recovery target is calculated via the default historical method (i.e., using average historical spectral values of the restoration site). The tool\u2019s reference approach to determining a recovery target is similar to the historical approach in that it uses the values of spectral indices. However, instead of taking the average value of pre-disturbance conditions, the recovery target is determined by the average index value across the reference sites at the current timestep.

Mangewa et al. (2022) found that habitat conditions were underestimated using Sentinel-2 10 m satellite imagery compared with approximately 8.5 cm resolution aerial-based imagery, also finding that while satellite imagery was able to detect the class of very good habitat conditions successfully, it was not as able to detect the poor or very poor condition classes. Generally, the result due to mixed pixels, is an overestimation of moderate condition vegetation (Mangewa et al., 2022). While using the tool, it is beneficial to keep in mind the resolution of the data and the implications for detail the imagery can reveal. Depending on the habitat, Sentinel-2 may offer advantages in revealing spatial heterogeneity of recovery that is not possible with Landsat.</p> <p>Spectral indices have long been proven effective at estimating the conditions of vegetation (Huete et al., 2002; Key &amp; Benson, 2006; Vogelmann et al., 2012; Zeng et al., 2022), however they provide an estimation of vegetation health using spectral indices as a proxy as opposed to a direct measurement of a recovery attribute such as vegetation height or stem density. Thus, the outputs of the tool should be validated using ground measurements, or external datasets such as those derived from LiDAR. For instance, rapid recovery of NDVI could indicate that native or natural vegetation is returning to an area after disturbance, but it could also mean that an invasive species has taken advantage of a lack of competition, which would then result in slower recovery rates and the disruption of successional stages (Burnett et al., 2019). However, a study by White et al. (2022) found that spectral recovery (of NBR) was successful in predicting recovery of structural attributes such as canopy cover and tree height, so it is still reasonable to assume relative accuracy in recovery estimation using multiple spectral indices.</p> <p>Some spectral indices may not be appropriate due to geographical locations of the study sites or their ecosystems, or even due to the satellite images available. It is encouraged to research the use of each index for specific ecosystems and forest types to ensure compatibility and efficacy in results.</p> <p>It is advisable to be critical in the interpretation of the results. Positive change in a spectral index does not necessarily equal recovery (as in the invasive species example mentioned above), and consistently high measures of the indices may not be desirable either. For example, if the aim of the restoration is to improve biodiversity and species richness, then it is perhaps more desirable for there to be variability in the spectral indices across the landscape. Variability in NDVI values, for instance, have shown to be correlated to habitat heterogeneity (Gould, 2000).</p> <p>Generally, the individual goals of each restoration project vary, and so the interpretation of the results should subsequently vary. The tool allows for a better general understanding of landscape conditions, with different spectral indices providing differing information. The tool output could be used in a subsequent analysis, with different data such as soil, climate, species, or habitat information overlaid, to further identify recovery progress in light of environmental variables.</p>"},{"location":"terminology/","title":"TERMINOLOGY","text":"<p>The spectral recovery tool uses a wide variety of terminology that can at times be hard to follow, especially when first trying to wrap your head around this tool.

The subsequent goals of conservation, adaptation, and mitigation are putting greater emphasis on both improvement and monitoring of ecosystems (Wortley et al., 2013). As a result, ecosystem restoration efforts, which aim to restore an area to a specified condition, and can involve passive, active, or hybrid regeneration techniques (Burnett et al., 2019; Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996) are becoming more widespread.</p> <p>Restoration has proven to be an effective tool to reverse ecosystem damage, while also increasing ecosystem resilience (Wortley et al., 2013). At the same time, an important outcome of restoration interventions has often been an increased functionality of ecosystems, and a greater availability of ecosystem goods and services (Atkinson et al., 2022; Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996). Because of the numerous potential benefits, the specific goals of restoration may differ between sites including aims such as increasing carbon storage, habitat value for species, or timber quality, with restoration techniques often tailored to reach those specific goals (Burnett et al., 2019). Depending on the restoration goals, the success of the ecosystem recovery is usually determined by measures of one or more categories of ecosystem characteristics: vegetation structure, biodiversity, and ecological functioning (Ruiz-Jaen &amp; Mitchell Aide, 2005).</p> <p>Monitoring restoration efforts typically involve field measurements, which can be expensive and infeasible, especially if the restoration site is inaccessible or covers large spatial extents. Especially challenging for effective monitoring is the ability to repeat the field measurements over time, to ensure that restoration efforts are still on track. These limitations often result in an incomplete understanding of the recovery process, with most restoration monitoring programs having durations of five years or less (Ruiz-Jaen &amp; Mitchell Aide, 2005). Yet recovery often occurs on much longer timescales, with biodiversity and structural regeneration requiring upwards of seven years to show progress (Chen et al., 2011; Pickell et al., 2016; Atkinson et al., 2022).</p> <p>Remote sensing offers a potential aid for these limitations, with open access, and operationally ready satellite data products allowing consistent, inexpensive, and repeatable measurements of ground conditions at a landscape scale (Cordell et al., 2017).  To date remote sensing techniques have not been used as frequently as field measurements, due in part to cost, access and the typical focus of fine scale site specific recovery strategies (Cordell et al., 2017). However, the increased emphasis on ecosystem restoration and management being landscape-focused (Cordell et al., 2017) makes remote sensing highly applicable to restoration monitoring frameworks.</p>"},{"location":"theoretical_basis/#12-using-spectral-indices-to-monitor-restoration-outcomes","title":"1.2 USING SPECTRAL INDICES TO MONITOR RESTORATION OUTCOMES","text":"<p>Freely available satellite imagery has resulted in advancements in the use of remote sensing data products and algorithms for monitoring the conditions of vegetation (Wulder et al., 2012), with a substantial number of analyses depending on spectral indices. Sometimes referred to as vegetation indices, spectral indices use reflectance from two or more spectral bands to produce an estimate of vegetation health (Zeng et al., 2022). Spectral indices have a long history as proxies for vegetation condition (Banskota et al., 2014) and have been correlated to a wide variety of ecosystem variables, such as ecosystem structure or function (Skidmore et al., 2021), enabling their use in estimating ecosystem recovery. For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is frequently used to monitor growing conditions and has been shown to correlate with leaf area index (LAI) (Zeng et al., 2022); whilst the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) is commonly used to assess vegetation conditions following wildfire, and is related to vegetation productivity and water stress (Key and Benson, 2006).</p> <p>Spectral indices are commonly used in time series analyses (Banskota et al., 2014) which assess how the indices change over time, often pre and post disturbance events, resulting in a spectral trajectory. By revealing how these indices have changed (in other words, by using the trajectories), it enables the characterization of disturbances, recovery, or both (Wulder et al., 2019). Subsequently, one can use these trajectories to calculate change metrics, such as change magnitude or change duration (Banskota et al., 2014; Wulder et al., 2019). Recent developments in the use of spectral information for ecosystem recovery detection have also resulted in a variety of recovery metrics that have proven to be useful for characterizing recovery specifically, such as Years to Recovery (Y2R) (Wulder et al., 2019; Frazier et al., 2018, De Keersmaecker et al., 2022). Along with these metrics, change algorithms have also been developed, however these are often complex, require parameterization, and are inaccessible to users unfamiliar with remote sensing or statistics (Cohen et al., 2018).</p>"},{"location":"theoretical_basis/#13-looking-at-recovery-trajectories","title":"1.3 LOOKING AT RECOVERY TRAJECTORIES","text":"<p>Generally, there are two main components of recovery that should be considered: recovery rate and recovery trajectory or shape (Montoya, 2021). Recovery rates and trajectories are often considered in remote sensing analyses, but they are hard to estimate when using ground data. This is primarily because revealing the rate and trajectory shape require repeated measurements of the conditions, which would be expensive to monitor using field data. Yet, recovery rates and trajectories reveal substantial information about the progress of the recovery, as it shows not only how quickly a site is recovering, but also how that rate is changing over time. It is this information offered by rates and trajectories that can be used for the calculation of recovery metrics, which consequently offer more information about recovery progress than a simple index value.</p> <p></p> <p>Figure 1. Displays two conceptual spectral recovery trajectories, following a disturbance and using a historical recovery target (A), and following a restoration intervention with a reference recovery target (B).</p> <p>A second consideration is timescales. There can be short-term and long-term recovery indicators, with some spectral indices providing information about short-term recovery and some indices providing more information about long-term recovery. For example, NDVI often increases quite quickly in the restoration process as it is sensitive to vegetation like grasses and shrubs, which often establish themselves rapidly after a disturbance (Hislop et al., 2018; Pickell et al., 2016). However, NDVI also saturates or plateaus at relatively low biomass densities (Chu et al., 2016; Pickell et al., 2016; White et al., 2017), so it may not provide much information as a long-term recovery indicator. NBR, on the other hand, has been shown to correlate more with vegetation structure, and is thus often used to estimate the re-establishment of trees or woody vegetation, as opposed to grasses (Frazier et al., 2015; Hislop et al., 2018; Pickell et al., 2016; White et al. 2017). Both indices provide complementary insight into the recovery progress of a site, and it is recommended to look at both short-term and long-term recovery indicators for this reason.</p> <p>Recovery trajectories following restoration can be variable, often being a nonlinear process that experiences interannual variation (Ruiz-Jaen &amp; Mitchell Aide, 2005). In fact, the first five years of a restoration project may see highly divergent trajectories across the site, due to stochasticity, variations in climate, and other highly localized environmental variables and processes (Matthews &amp; Spyreas, 2010). This is especially true with the increasingly rapid climate changes due to anthropogenic activities (Suding et al., 2015). Because of this interannual variation, a trajectory may change year-to-year, which is why it is recommended to run the tool annually to assess the recovery progress. However, it is also expected that there will be variability in the spectral trajectories, and a decreased recovery rate for a single year may not be cause for concern.</p> <p>Spectral trajectories often differ with disturbance severity and disturbance types (Bright et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2011; Chu et al., 2016; Schroeder et al., 2011), or local environment such as the amount of precipitation that is received, or differences in previous land cover, soils, nutrient availabilities, and ecosystem types (Epting &amp; Verbyla, 2005; Frazier et al., 2015; Frolking et al., 2009; Kennedy et al., 2012). Spectral trajectories can also vary by forest type or dominant species (Frazier et al. 2015; Bright et al., 2019). For example, Morresi et al. (2019) found that broadleaved trees recovery more quickly than conifers. Spectral indices will also display different trajectories (Cohen et al., 2018; Pickell et al., 2016) so it is important to consider what information each index offers as an ecological indicator, and be aware of its limitations. Altogether these differences indicate a key reason why this tool, which monitors individual areas through time using multiple indices, is necessary for understanding forest restoration and recovery, as generalizations across both time and space cannot be made.</p>"},{"location":"theoretical_basis/#14-recovery-targets","title":"1.4 RECOVERY TARGETS","text":"<p>A necessary component of monitoring restoration success is having an appropriate recovery target for a restoration site (Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996; Ruiz-Jaen &amp; Mitchell Aide, 2005). In the field of ecological restoration, users should clearly define measurable target ecosystem attributes (Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996), which identify the degree of recovery desired for the degraded area (Gann et al., 2019). The most common approach for measuring restoration success, is to measure the similarity between the restoration site and these recovery targets (Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996). The field of remote sensing also frequently estimates restoration success by assessing similarity of a restoration site to a recovery target condition, via the comparison of spectral index values to pre-disturbance conditions (Frazier et al., 2018; White et al., 2017).</p> <p>Each of these approaches is described in more detail below.</p> <p>DETERMINING THE RECOVERY TARGET USING A HISTORICAL APPROACH</p> <p>A historical approach uses a historical condition of a restoration site as the recovery target. This is the most common approach in the field of remote sensing, with the readily available satellite imagery in the Landsat archives dating back to 1984 making it possible to select a historical recovery target. Support for this approach has grown as there has been increasing freely available historic satellite imagery, with Sentinel-2 imagery's earliest historical period being 2016. In annual time series trajectory analyses, the recovery target is frequently set by taking the average spectral value of the two years prior to the start of the disturbance (De Keersmaecker et al., 2022; Pickell et al., 2016; White et al., 2017). As spectral trajectories can be noisy and subject to interannual variation, an average is taken to represent the general pre-disturbance condition to offset any potential noise in the spectral trajectory of those two years (Pickell et al., 2016). </p> <p>DETERMINING THE RECOVERY TARGET USING A REFERENCE APPROACH</p> <p>The second, recommended approach for determining recovery targets within the field of ecological restoration is the use of reference systems (Gann et al., 2019). Reference systems are areas within the same landscape of the restoration site which exhibit desirable ecosystem attributes and represent a healthy or stable ecosystem condition (Gann et al., 2019). These are often attributed to be natural or semi-natural ecosystems which could have been similar to the restoration site's state if not for the site's degradation or disturbance (Gann et al., 2019). The use of reference systems is built on the recognition that within an ecosystem, there are multiple possible meta-states depending on environmental drivers such as climate or species which may affect the successional dynamics, and that ecosystems are always in a state of change (Gann et al., 2019; Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996). Ecological restoration frameworks strongly encourage the use of reference systems over historical conditions, as the latter target might be impossible or even undesirable to reach. This is primarily due to changes in biotic and abiotic conditions, especially in the context of climate change and the importance of ecosystem resilience (Gann et al., 2019). Yet, to determine restoration successful, a target is still required which is where reference systems become integral.</p> <p>By incorporating a number of reference systems into the recovery target, it allows for a range of dynamic conditions making restoration success more feasible (Hobbs &amp; Norton, 1996). It also helps to avoid any potential bias in reference system selection, as choosing one may result in only the highest quality site being chosen (which may be unattainable) or failure to include systems that that experience the same conditions as the restoration site (Atkinson et al. 2022).</p>"},{"location":"theoretical_basis/#15-recovery-metrics","title":"1.5 RECOVERY METRICS","text":"<p>Recovery metrics allow for the characterization or spectral trends through time, using the spectral trajectories to result in standardized and comparable numeric variables (Wulder et al., 2019). There are five common recovery metrics, which are each informed by previous research (De Keersmaecker et al., 2022; Frazier et al., 2018; Pickell et al., 2016; White et al., 2017).</p> <p>A choice of metrics is included to make the outputs applicable to different research or monitoring objectives, and offer differing information. \u2206Index(regrowth) quantifies the absolute change during a restoration window, whilst YrYr uses this absolute change to derive an average annual rate of change. R80P allows for the quantification of recovery progress relative to a recovery target, while the Y2R metric reveals how long it took for the recovery process to occur. RRI is distinct from other metrics, as it relates the change during the restoration window to the change due to the disturbance, essentially scaling the recovery to the disturbance severity (Frazier et al., 2018). </p> <p>Visualising of per-pixel recovery metrics enables a clearer understanding of the recovery progress across an entire landscape. Subsequent spatial analyses using these tool outputs can include measures of spatial autocorrelation with external variables, cluster analyses, or measures of spatial heterogeneity. This could prove useful to identifying any spatial patterns or trends in recovery in the landscape, or the potential to identify which external factors (such as restoration treatments, topography, soil, dominant species, precipitation, etc.) are more significant drivers of ecological recovery. Conversely, this can also aid in the identification of areas that could require further restoration activities to aid in the recovery process.</p>"},{"location":"theoretical_basis/#2-acknowledgements-and-references","title":"2.
